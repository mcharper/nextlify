Hired for 6 months (extended to 9) with a co-developer to design and develop a vehicle tracking system for use by Highways England: a tablet application for roadside use by traffic officers, and a portal for control room monitors to map incidents in real time around the regions. We integrated with the Apex ANS network to handle messages about vehicle locations.



Despite the challenges of Covid-19 (we worked almost exclusively from home, performing two-weekly demos via Microsoft Teams) and the innovative nature of the technologies, we delivered a robust system that users are very happy with. Probably my most enjoyable project to date.



Used React, Redux, TypeScript, Material UI, ASP.Net Core 3.1, with Rethink DB real-time database, push technology, RabbitMQ for messaging and Open Street Map. We used kubernetes to provide a development platform.
