  Als Entwickler auf Vertragsbasis bekommt man oft nicht mit, ob der erstellte Code langfristig einfach zu pflegen ist. Darum bleibe ich mit ehemaligen Kollegen und Vorgesetzten in Kontakt und bitte um Rückmeldung. So profitieren meine Kunden und auch ich kann meine Arbeit kontinuierlich verbessern. Beispielsweise verwendet einer meiner frühesten Kunden, die Bank First Direct, auch nach mehr als 20 Jahren weiterhin einen Code von mir! Lassen auch Sie sich langfristig von meinen Kompetenzen überzeugen.

        Mike had worked previously at FMG as a contract developer on a transformation project. The quality and professionalism of Mike meant that we extended him several times after this initial project was completed to work on other projects. Due to his previous excellent work, I didn't hesitate to ask Mike back to help deliver a large high profile project with dates that couldn't slip earlier this year. I would not hesitate to recommend or use Mike again. He will be an asset to any development team.

        We hired Michael for his specialist expertise. He quickly integrated into our values based culture and added value from day one. He fit in so well and mixed well with our people he stayed with us for many years on a contract basis! He naturally developed less experienced people around him too. I valued Michael for his knowledge, recommendations for pushing our boundaries ... He can communicate easily with other developers, testers and indeed clients. Hence I have no hesitation in recommending him!

        I worked with Mike for over 2 years whilst he was working with Havas Lynx. Mike is a diligent and unflappable professional that works well in pressurised environments. He is eager to learn new skills and he has good people skills. I feel he would be an asset for any client and he's also a really friendly, laid back person. It was a pleasure working with Mike and I would be happy to do so in the future.

        ... he has helped the business by providing a crucial and robust piece of software at a time of exponential growth. I would not hesitate in taking Mike on again for future work. ...

        Mike is an excellent team player demonstrated by his ability to pick up new skills and his willingness to freely share his own knowledge for the benefit of the team. He has demonstrated this ability on numerous occasions when programme issues have arisen, during ‘think tank’ meetings working towards issue resolution and risk mitigation.

        Michael worked really well as part of the team and was always willing to help his junior/new members. He is technically sound and seems to have a solution to most technical problems assigned to him. Always dedicated and shows commitment even for the smaller tasks. It was a pleasure working with him.
