## Why should I hire you?

Do you need a conscientious dev who can add value quickly? Who can fit smoothly into your project team? You might want to look at my <a href="/testimonials">Testimonials</a>.

## Do you only do contract work?

Yes. I've been a contractor for over 25 years. I like the variety and flexibility. Typically I work on a day rate basis.

## Where are you based?

It hardly seems to matter nowadays, does it? Anyway it's Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. I've worked remotely off and on since 2007, exclusively so since March 2020 from a dedicated home office.

By the way, are you based in Germany, Austria or Switzerland? I also speak fluent German (C2 qualified - near-native proficiency) and am always happy to use it at work.
