  Since starting to use React I've found myself working increasingly at the front end, though I combined this with C# and ASP.Net in a recent project.

  I've had a long career in development though. Since 2000 I've focused on web applications. My background is full stack.
  The variety of languages and technologies involved and their constant evolution keeps me interested and curious, and allows me to continually improve what I can offer users.

    I started developing for the web in 2000. I've been using JavaScript to write SPAs since I discovered AJAX!
    Since then I've used JQuery, Ext JS, Durandl, AngularJS, and now React, my preferred framework. I'm experimenting with NextJS - this site is built on it. Since 2019 I've mostly used TypeScript - I really like it.

    My web development work started out with classic ASP, leading to ASP.Net Core using C#. I've used SQL Server since about 2000 but also worked with MongoDB and more recently RethinkDB, a real-time database. I've mainly used Entity Framework as an ORM but also NHibernate and Dapper.

    I develop mostly on Windows but am happy right now in Linux (I was originally from a Unix background).
    I edit in VSCode and Visual Studio, with Git for source control (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket), 
    and various CI and release management systems, for example Gitlab, TFS, Azure DevOps, Octopus Deploy.
    Cloud-wise I worked briefly with AWS recently, and have experimented with Azure. I have exposure to Docker and Kubernetes.

    I'm used to working in an agile environment, sometimes based on Scrum, sometimes Kanban.
    By the time I join a project the client has already chosen a tool to manage it so I'm familiar with a few. 
    I've used TFS (now Azure DevOps) off and on since 2012, Jira on and off since 2014. I'm using Shortcut now.
    I've also worked with Target Process and Trello.

    People say they value my ability to fit in and make a positive contribution that complements 
    their team's work. If I do suggest improvements I do so constructively. I'm pragmatic. I enjoy collaborating, pair programming, mentoring, presenting and (perhaps unusually) documenting! I am used to working in  
    international teams and enjoy this.

# Skills and technical interests

I build web applications using React, TypeScript, C# and ASP.Net Core and other related technologies.

I've been using Shortcut recently for story and ticket management but have also used TFS, JIRA and Target Process. All the projects I have worked on in recent years have taken an agile / scrum approach in one form or another. Clients usually already have an approach which works for them.

Regarding techniques, I try to apply SOLID principles where appropriate. I understand Object Oriented Design of course but other paradigms are also finding a place, particularly Functional Programming, and I am open to these.

I use a TDD approach where possible because I believe it results in better-designed, more robust, and more adaptable software.

In terms of development tools, I use Visual Studio and VSCode commercially. I also use Resharper which I find very helpful. I use npm for managing front-end build processes and package management. I've been using Git for source control since about 2014, using Git bash, GitKraken, SourceTree and other tools. I've also used Subversion, TFS and other source code control systems.

Iâ€™ve done a lot of physical database design of relational databases. In my last contract I used RethinkDB because of its real time capabilities allowing data to be pushed to observers. Over the last few years I've also used MongoDB for some projects. More recently I've become interested in Graph databases such as Neo4J, which requires a different way of thinking but which looks very useful for certain kinds of problem, such as discovering relationships in datasets.

You can see some of the code I write in my spare time on GitHub.
