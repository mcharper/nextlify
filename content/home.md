  I am a senior developer with many years' experience across a range of sectors. I work at all levels of the stack using JavaScript frameworks combined with ASP.Net Core and C# at the back end. Over the last few years I've worked more at
  the front end as I enjoy using React and TypeScript.
subText: >
  I also do analysis and design, mentoring and regularly run meetings and customer demos. I stay close to development though because I enjoy it. I like the flexibility offered by contracting, and the variety of being involved in new projects and meeting new people.
