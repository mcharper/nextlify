  I am a senior full-stack developer with many years' experience across a range of sectors. I work now primarily with React  and the Microsoft .Net stack. Since discovering React I've come to prefer front end work.
lead2: >
  I stay close to development because I enjoy it. Contracting allows me to keep learning and adopting technology as it improves. But I also help with architectural decisions, analyse, design, mentor, write tests, and regularly run meetings and customer demos. My long experience as contractor means I can adapt to a team quickly and start adding value early on.

  ## How I work ##
  I've remained a contractor for over 25 years as I like the variety and flexibility it brings. 

  Typically I work on fixed term contracts which start as 3-6 months but are often extended, some for many years. I work on a time and materials basis (usually a day rate).

  Occasionally I also work for clients on a more flexible basis. This usually involves relatively small projects I can fit around a full-time contract.

  ## Where I work ##
  I'm based in Huddersfield. But I've worked remotely off and on since 2007, and continuously since March 2020, now from a dedicated home office. 
  
  I am happy to work remotely for clients further afield, including Europe. I speak fluent German (C2 level, representing near-native proficiency), so I would be happy to work remotely for clients in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
