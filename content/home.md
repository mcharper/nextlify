  I am a senior developer with extensive experience across many sectors. I have worked at all levels of the stack using JavaScript frameworks combined with ASP.Net Core and C# at the back end.
  I enjoy using React and TypeScript and for that reason I've been working mainly at the front end recently.
subText: >
  I also do analysis and design and I am used to running planning meetings, standups, and customer demos. I also enjoy mentoring. I stay close to development though because I enjoy it. I like the flexibility offered by contracting, and the variety of being involved in new projects and meeting new people.
