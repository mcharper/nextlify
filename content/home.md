  ## Why should I hire you? ## 

  Do you need a conscientious dev who can add value quickly? Who can fit smoothly into your project team? You might want to look at my <a href="/testimonials">Testimonials</a>. 

  If now isnâ€™t the right time you could subscribe to my <a href="https://twitter.com/mcharper" target="blank">Twitter</a> account for updates.

  ## Do you only do contract work? ## 

  Yes. I've been a contractor for over 25 years. I like the variety and flexibility. Typically I work on a day rate basis.

  ## Where are you based? ## 

  It hardly seems to matter nowadays, does it? Anyway it's Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. I've worked remotely off and on since 2007, exclusively so since March 2020 from a dedicated home office.

  By the way, are you based in Germany, Austria or Switzerland? I also speak fluent German (C2 qualified - near-native proficiency) and am always happy to use it at work.
