I am a senior developer with extensive experience across many sectors. I have worked at all levels of the stack.
I enjoy using React and TypeScript and for that reason I've been working mainly at the front end recently.

I also do analysis and design work, participate in user meetings and am used to running planning meetings, standups, and customer demos. I also enjoy an element of mentoring. But I stay close to development because I enjoy building things. 

I like the flexibility offered by contracting, and the variety of being involved in new projects and meeting new people. I fit easily into a team being diplomatic and easy-going.
