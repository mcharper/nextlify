### I write web applications ... ###

using React, TypeScript, ASP.Net Core, C#, and SQL Server using the best tools I can find eg: Visual Studio, VSCode, Resharper, Git.

### ... I do both front end application work ###

I've been working on single page apps with a significant JavaScript component for as long as I can remember.

I prefer React over other front-end technologies, though I also have experience of: Angular, AngularJS and Durandl before that. I prefer TypeScript but Iâ€™m also comfortable with JavaScript and its ecosystem and of course HTML and CSS.

### ... and back end application work ###

I use ASP.Net Core to provide REST services to support such systems, and develop back end services using C#, Entity Framework, RabbitMQ.

### ... and have other useful skills ###

I also do analysis and design work, participating in user meetings and sometimes running standups and sprint demos, and an element of mentoring. I stay close to development though because I like building things.

### I like working in a team ... ###

I fit easily into a team being diplomatic and easy-going. Read what other people say.

### ... and I like working for myself ###

I like the flexibility offered by contracting, and the variety of being involved in new projects and meeting new people. So if you need a contractor and I fit the bill please contact me below.
