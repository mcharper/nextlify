        Mike had previously worked at FMG as a contract developer on a transformation project. The quality and professionalism of Mike meant that we extended him several times after this initial project was completed to work on other projects. Due to his previous excellent work, I didn't hesitate to ask Mike back to help deliver a large high profile project with dates that couldn't slip earlier this year. I would not hesitate to recommend or use Mike again. He will be an asset to any development team.

        We hired Michael for his specialist expertise. He quickly integrated into our values based culture and added value from day one. He fit in so well and mixed well with our people he stayed with us for many years on a contract basis! He naturally developed less experienced people around him too. I valued Michael for his knowledge, recommendations for pushing our boundaries, he was self-managing so I could confidently leave him to development. ... He can communicate easily with other developers, tester and indeed clients. Hence I have no hesitation in recommending him!

        I worked with Mike for over 2 years whilst he was working with Havas Lynx. Mike is a diligent and unflappable professional that works well in pressurised environments. He is eager to learn new skills and he has good people skills. I feel he would be an asset for any client and he's also a really friendly, laid back person. It was a pleasure working with Mike and I would be happy to do so in the future.

        Mike spends the time to make sure that his applications are thoroughly tested, and work in the most sensible and resource friendly fashion. He has great attention to detail, and is very meticulous. Mike also manages to produce code that is very sympathetic to existing coding practices and dovetails nicely into the existing codebase. 
        I cannot speak highly enough of Mike, he has been an excellent addition to the team and has helped the business by providing a crucial and robust piece of software at a time of exponential growth. I would not hesitate in taking Mike on again for future work. ...

        Mike is an excellent team player demonstrated by his ability to pick up new skills and his willingness to freely share his own knowledge for the benefit of the team. He has demonstrated this ability on numerous occasions when programme issues have arisen, during ‘think tank’ meetings working towards issue resolution and risk mitigation.

        Michael worked really well as part of the team and was always willing to help his junior/new members. He is technically sound and seems to have a solution to most technical problems assigned to him. Always dedicated and shows commitment even for the smaller tasks. It was a pleasure working with him.

    #     Mike was a valuable member of our ASP.Net team at Promethean. It is plainly obvious that he knows exactly what he is doing technically, that he has a wealth of experience, and that he can easily adapt to a team's processes and business requirements. But Mike also had (which most other developers don't) a willingness to help others on the team by giving them time, even at his own expense. Mike would often help me (especially at first when integrating into the team) and never complained if he had to do the "less interesting" work, i.e. not the new greenfield development and design which we developers all like to do. All in all, he was sorely missed as part of the team when he left.

    #     On a personal note he has been an excellent person to have in the team from a morale perspective and actively contributed to a proactive and friendly working environment. Given the opportunity I would definitely offer him future contracts should he be available.
